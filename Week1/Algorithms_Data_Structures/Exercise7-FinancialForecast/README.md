# Exercise 7 - Financial Forecasting

A recursive program to predict future value based on a fixed growth rate.

#File
- FinancialForecast.java

#Description
The program calculates future financial value by applying compound growth recursively over a number of years.

#Method Used
Recursion

#Formula
Future Value = Present Value × (1 + Rate)^Years

#Time Complexity
O(n)

#Input
Value = 10000  
Rate = 10%  
Years = 5

#Output
Future Value after 5 years: 16105.1
