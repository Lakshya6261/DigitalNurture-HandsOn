# Cognizant Hands-on Exercise 3: Assertions in JUnit

This project demonstrates how to use different assertions in JUnit to validate test results.

## Requirements
- Java
- Maven

## Steps to Run

1. Open terminal inside project folder.
2. Run the following command to execute the tests:

   mvn test

## What It Tests

assertEquals: Checks equality of expected and actual values.
assertTrue: Validates that a condition is true.
assertFalse: Validates that a condition is false.
assertNull: Confirms that an object is null.
assertNotNull: Confirms that an object is not null.

## Project Files

- `AssertionsTest.java` : Contains JUnit tests with different assertions.
- `pom.xml` : Maven configuration with JUnit dependency.
