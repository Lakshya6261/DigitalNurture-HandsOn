## Requirements
- Java
- Maven

## Steps to Run

1. Open terminal inside project folder.
2. Run the following command to execute tests:

   mvn test

## Project Files

Calculator.java : Contains simple add and multiply methods.
CalculatorTest.java : Contains JUnit tests following the AAA pattern with setup and teardown methods.
pom.xml : Maven configuration with JUnit dependency.
